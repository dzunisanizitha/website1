    <p>Learning is a continuous journey, not a destination. It is about embracing curiosity, being open to mistakes, and finding growth in every challenge. Progress may be slow at times, but each step forward builds a stronger foundation. What matters most is showing up, staying consistent, and believing in the process.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Learning is a journey of steady steps, not instant results.</p>
